# J-stroke _A new way to think about NBA Players_
_J-stroke is a project undertaken to examine the current methods of basketball player evaluations and is a data visualization tool to complement currently used methods. The developers were very interested in building a tool that not only communicates the playing style and patters of a player, but also helps compare different players with different playing styles._
